        <span class="contiptitle">WHILE IN MADRID</span><br/>
        We love this city SO much. Whether you're here for 10 years or 10 days,
        there's enough stuff in Madrid to keep you entertained non-stop. Try the
        Prado and Reina Sofia when they're free, if you don't mind the crowds.
        Pay the entry fee for the Thyssen &ndash; it's worth it. Go drinking in La
        Latina on a Sunday afternoon. Take a tour of the impressive Bernab&eacute;u
        stadium, but watch an actual match at the Vicente Calder&oacute;n where
        Atl&eacute;tico de Madrid play (cheaper tickets, better atmosphere). Hit up the
        Rastro but head off the main drag for real bargains. Watch the sunset at
        Templo de Debod.  Go to the Retiro, Parque del Oeste or Casa de Campo
        for some nature. Jump on a train to visit the mountains or surrounding
        towns and truly get away from it all. Take in a flamenco show. Sit out
        on a terraza and people-watch. Go for a walk and see where your feet
        take you.

        <span class="contiptitle">TIPS FOR YOU VISIT</span><br/>
        The Metro is the cheapest and easiest way of getting into town from the
        airport, although taxis and buses are readily available. If you're
        staying in the centre (the area on the map) walking is the best and most
        interesting way to get around. Madrid is a safe city but watch out for
        pickpockets, especially in tourist hotspots, outdoor caf&eacute;s and on the
        Metro. Report any robberies to the police immediately.

        Spaniards are very friendly and helpful, so don't be afraid to
        ask about anything. Remember to take directions with a pinch of salt
        though, as places can often be made to sound much further away than they
        actually are. You can still smoke in most restaurants, bars and clubs,
        although some have non-smoking sections. There's no set rule for tipping,
        but most of the time leaving a euro or so is ok. Spain works on a
        different timetable to the rest of Europe: the day starts late and
        finishes extremely late. And even though Madrid is a capital city, the
        pace of life here is more relaxed. Slow down your walking speed and take
        your time if you want to blend in!
